<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulmonary Surfactant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthetic Pulmonary Surfactants</li><li>Animal Derived Surfactants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pulmonary surfactant market is divided into two main types: synthetic pulmonary surfactants and animal-derived surfactants. Synthetic surfactants are manufactured through chemical processes and are designed to mimic natural lung surfactants, offering consistent quality and reduced risk of disease transmission. Animal-derived surfactants, on the other hand, are extracted from animal lungs, primarily bovine or porcine sources, and contain natural components that aid in surfactant replacement therapies. Each type plays a critical role in treating respiratory distress, particularly in premature infants.</p></p>
