<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immersion Cooling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Phase Immersion Cooling</li><li>Two-Phase Immersion Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immersion cooling system market is primarily divided into two types: single-phase and two-phase immersion cooling. Single-phase immersion cooling involves submerging electronic components in a non-conductive liquid that remains in a single state throughout the cooling process. In contrast, two-phase immersion cooling utilizes a fluid that undergoes phase changeâ€”evaporating to absorb heat and then condensing to release it. Both systems offer efficient thermal management, reducing energy consumption and enhancing the performance and longevity of electronic equipment.</p></p>
