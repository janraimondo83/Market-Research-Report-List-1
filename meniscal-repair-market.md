<p><p>The meniscal repair market is primarily categorized into two types: all-inside and outside-in repair techniques. All-inside repair involves the use of specialized tools to place sutures entirely within the joint, promoting faster recovery and minimal incision. Outside-in repair, on the other hand, accesses the meniscus from outside the joint, allowing for easier manipulation of tissue and suture placement but often requiring larger incisions.
