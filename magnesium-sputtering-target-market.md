<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The magnesium sputtering target market can be categorized into two main types: rotary and non-rotatable targets. Rotary sputtering targets enable continuous and uniform deposition by allowing the target to rotate during the sputtering process, enhancing the efficiency of material use and deposition quality. In contrast, non-rotatable targets remain fixed, which may limit uniformity but are often simpler and more cost-effective for certain applications. Both types cater to different manufacturing needs, influencing the choice based on application requirements and deposition techniques.</p></p>
